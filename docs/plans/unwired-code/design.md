# Find and judge every unwired and dead piece of code

## Goal

Every production symbol, member, field, parameter and union member is reached by production, deleted, or kept with a cited reason. One concept has one home.

## Shape

Ports derive from their owners so references follow the composition root. The unwired scans then report what no production path reaches, from whole exports down to fields, parameters and union members. Each finding is wired, deleted, or kept with a cited ledger reason.

### Order

Fix a server bug a scan exposes before judging fields. Judge fields in bulk after that.

| Step | Work | Items |
| - | - | - |
| 1 | Judge every member the member scan reports | the unwired-member items the 1439 report boards, 0501, and the possibly dead guards the restoration lanes found |
| 2 | Judge the first full run of each new scan | the [judgement items](#judgement-items) |
| 3 | Adjudicate unused exports through the package doors | 0989 |
| 4 | Hold the domain template with dependency rules | [1443](../../work/1443-enforce-domain-contract-purity-with-a-dependency-cruiser.md), [1423](../../work/1423-move-i-o-out-of-domain-substrate-folders.md), [1463](../../work/1463-chat-persistence-reads-the-assets-characters-and-personas.md) |

## Rejected

A CI gate on scan output, a baseline of accepted findings, and keeping code because it looks deliberate without a cited ruling.

## Coupled sites

docs/adr/0337-owner-built-statements-join-another-domains-batch.md; docs/law/Core-0-Architecture-and-Structure.md §4; tooling/src/unwired/; knip.

## Test plan

Each scan ships fixtures for a found case and a false-positive control. Each deletion keeps the affected suites green; each wiring adds a production-path test.

## Deleted keys

A deleted tRPC input key strips silently under `z.object`. A sweep of every landed deletion found no live sender of a deleted key. The sweep and its method are in the Evidence of [1711](../../work/1711-a-deletion-branch-fails-when-a-removed-contract.md), which automates the check.

## Engine disagreements

The fields scan's two engines disagree on some rows. Every row is decidable inside one program, so the cause is not a gap between tsconfig worlds. Engine one judges, and find-references audits one way: a disagreement means engine two found a production site in a role engine one lacks. 1715 owns that change and holds the classification, the program sets, the time and memory profile, and the TypeScript 6 retirement order. 1697 owns the write and read forms neither engine follows.

## Limits of the fields scan

Engine one links a hand-off through a generic constraint, a spread into a typed literal down its nested members, an `in` check and a key typed by a type parameter. These forms stay reported as findings, so judge them by hand:

- A computed key built from runtime strings, such as a template of `prefix` and `suffix`, types as `string`. No name is known, so no field is read or written.
- A type-level registry entry reached only through `Registry[K]` in a type position. The scan counts a type position as no read, so the entry needs a value read by name.
- A read inside a string, such as a JSON scenario file.

## Judging a finding

Each item step 2 lists gives every finding of one scan in one domain a class (wire, delete, deliberate with a cited ruling, or unknown) and a decision. A class marked `(read)` was judged from the cited code. The others follow these rules:

| Scan | Finding | Class | Decision |
| - | - | - | - |
| fields | `unreferenced` | delete | delete the field or key |
| fields | `never-read` | delete | delete the field and its writes |
| fields | `never-read` on a client `…Vars` type | wire | derive it from the router input |
| fields | `never-read` on every reported field of a home | unknown | find the slot the value flows into and derive it from this type |
| fields | `never-written` type member | delete | delete the field and the branch that reads its default |
| fields | `never-written` schema key | unknown | name the outside writer, or delete the key and its default branch |
| params | `unsupplied`, `unsupplied-prop` | delete | delete the parameter or prop and its default path |
| params | `same-literal` | delete | inline the literal and drop the parameter |
| unions | `unbuilt` | delete | delete the member and the branches, checks and keys that name it |
| unions | `parsed` | unknown | keep the member only while the parsed source can produce it |
| shapes | `restated`, both sides a verb's `…Params` or `…Result` | deliberate | `docs/law/Core-0-Architecture-and-Structure.md` §4 |
| shapes | `restated` | unknown | judge by concept; keep one home only when both name one concept |
| shapes | `reexport-chain` | delete | export from the home |
| shapes | `renamed-reexport` | delete | use the home name |
| shapes | `synonym` | delete; deliberate for a per-verb name or the observability `Logger` | the scan's synonym rows |

The port census and the `orb/derived-port-member` rule follow a value only through a member, a forwarding lambda, a spread and a destructured member. They do not follow a value through a local binding: a `let` is rebound, so no single member stands behind its name. A port member fed through a `let` hop is invisible to both, so judge it by hand and type the member by its owner. The case `a member a let hop carries to the port` in `tests/tooling/eslint-derived-port-member.test.ts` holds the limit.

Before you delete an input key, search for the key name with a literal `rg` across `packages`, `tests`, `tooling` and `scripts`, and read every writer of its procedure. `z.object` strips an unknown key without an error, and a writer through an `as const` object or a spread passes the compiler, so a clean typecheck proves nothing.

A finding in `packages/contracts/src/plugin/` or `packages/plugin-sdk/` sits under each item's Plugin API heading: guests reach that surface from outside the tree, so keep it unless no guest can reach it. A row that looks like a half-built feature sits under Owner calls.
