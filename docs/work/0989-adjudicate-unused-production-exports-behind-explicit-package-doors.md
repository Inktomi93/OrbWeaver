# Adjudicate unused production exports behind explicit package doors

## What

Use the native production Knip inventory and shrink-only baseline to review unused public re-exports and implementation exports in cohesive package or domain batches. Remove unnecessary surface, follow real callers, delete genuinely unused code, and retain deliberately supported external APIs with their actual contract. Explicit package paths are implemented; symbol-level adjudication is not complete.

## Why

Closing wildcard package paths exposes unused symbols but does not remove them. Tests and tooling must not keep production code falsely alive, and a baseline entry is debt rather than authority.

## Done when

The recorded production inventory is fully adjudicated in package/domain batches. Each batch records production roots and consumer scope. Removed exports preserve real callers; retained external APIs have explicit contracts. Baseline debt shrinks without new exemptions. No custom liveness reader or fake consumer is added.

## Evidence

Detailed implementation and qualification evidence is preserved in `reports/review/tooling-park-2026-10-21/work-before/0989-adjudicate-unused-production-exports-behind-explicit-package-doors.md`.

This work is owner-parked outside both test-rebuild plans. Preserve source, reports and unfinished qualifications; resume only with explicit owner authorization.
