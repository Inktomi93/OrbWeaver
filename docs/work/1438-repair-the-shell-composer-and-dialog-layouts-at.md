# Repair the shell, composer and dialog layouts at 200% and 300% text

## What

Repair the defects that `tests/client/features/app-shell/surfaces/platform-text-scale.suite.ct.tsx` found at enlarged text (item 1299 Evidence lists each case). Rulings:

- Topbar at 300% (Show details, Report a bug past the edge) and the desktop Context panel header at 200% (Character actions, Close details, token hint past the edge): actions that do not fit move into the header's overflow menu. They never wrap or clip.
- Composer at 200% on a phone and 300% everywhere: the two-row composer ruling stands. Secondary actions (Try another reply, Continue the reply) move into the composer menu when they do not fit; Generate reply stays visible.
- Room at 300%: Jump to latest renders above the flank row and is never clipped by it.
- Characters list band at 200% on a phone: Import, New character and Show details drop below the header and sit under the Search field (hit test finds them covered). They stay reachable and uncovered, moving into the band's overflow menu when they do not fit.
- Import dialog at 300% on a phone: the dialog viewport gutter steps down at narrow inline sizes through a token condition, so the dialog keeps a readable width.

## Why

Item 1299 requires the topbar, panels, room and dialogs to stay usable at 200% and 300% text. These are the failures its probe recorded.

## Done when

Each listed case is added to the text-scale suite and passes on Chromium and WebKit at 390x844 and 1440x900, and the probe's planted overflow control still fails.

## Evidence

- Not built. The probe case for the phone Characters list band at 200% was run on Chromium and is red on the current tree: Import, New character and Show details (88x88 and 96x96 boxes) are covered at their centres by the Search field. Cause: below `32rem` the topbar wraps (`shell/chrome.css`), and its trail row falls under the list pane. The ruling moves actions that do not fit into an overflow menu. That needs one measured overflow mechanism over the registry-driven topbar trail widgets (each needs a menu form), the Context header and the band; none exists, and it is a design decision. The Jump to latest case is in `message-list-surface.tsx` and the dialog gutter token is in the tokens tree, both owned by sibling lanes.
