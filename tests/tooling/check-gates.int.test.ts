// Pins that EVERY ts-morph/fs structural gate actually fires on a violation — the gate self-test the
// dep-cruiser suite has, now for scripts/check/gates/*. A gate with a broken regex / AST query silently
// matches nothing and passes green (the exact failure the dep-cruiser test was built to catch); this is
// its structural-gate twin. The gate registry is DERIVED from `report.ts`'s own output (every gate it
// prints must fire on some fixture) — so a new gate added without a fixture FAILS here (anti-drift).
//
// Each fixture is a minimal violation at the path its gate anchors on, all named `__g_*` so cleanup is a
// single find -prune -rm. We run `check:structure` clean (→ the registry), then with fixtures (→ the
// fired set), and assert every registered gate is in the fired set.
